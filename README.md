EcoreToWebEditor

This project describes an automated process for generating Web-based text modeling environments. In particular, starting from a meta-model, it has been defined:
- a canonical mapping for the definition of the textual (concrete) syntax;
- the generation of its modeling environment.
The whole process is carried out by a Java command line application that uses the interaction of transformation engines of models and frameworks such as Acceleo and Xtext.
